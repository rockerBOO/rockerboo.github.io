Almost 30. Been a web developer for 13 years, working on e-commerce, social networks, web builder products. Portfolio: [rockerBOO][davelage]

Previously designed and developed the core system that runs [Virb][virb]. Currently still running perfectly with no developers, 18 months after I left.

Got into systems work in the past 4 years, where I found automation to be the most fun part. Creating automation in games is fun and all, but nothing compared to working with large scale systems, processing unimaginable amounts of data.

In the last 4 years, I have extensively been researching and connecting with Nature. How everything connects together, and works in balance over time is very interesting to think about.
